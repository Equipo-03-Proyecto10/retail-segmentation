# Infrastructure

Record of the provisioned GCP resources. Updated as later F1 stories add
firewall rules, PostgreSQL, and the reverse proxy.

## Compute Engine instance

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | `mosaiq-deployment-vm` |
| Project | `iac-dev-01` |
| Zone | `northamerica-south1-a` (Querétaro, Mexico — closest GCP region to the team) |
| Machine type | `e2-standard-2` (2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM) |
| Boot disk | 50 GB, `pd-balanced` |
| Image | `centos-stream-10` (project `centos-cloud`) |

Created for `F1-01`.

## Network access

The instance has the `mosaiq-server` network tag. Its ingress policy uses
higher-priority exceptions for the two required public ports followed by an
explicit deny rule:

| Rule | Priority | Source | Action |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `mosaiq-allow-ssh` | 900 | `0.0.0.0/0` | Allow `tcp:22` |
| `mosaiq-allow-http` | 900 | `0.0.0.0/0` | Allow `tcp:80` |
| `mosaiq-deny-other-ingress` | 1000 | `0.0.0.0/0` | Deny all other ingress |

The project default network is shared with the terminated `webdev-centos`
instance, so its pre-existing default rules were not changed. For
`mosaiq-deployment-vm`, the rules above take precedence over those default
rules, which have priority 65534. This limits effective ingress to SSH and
HTTP without changing the other instance's policy.

## SSH access

OS Login is enabled on `mosaiq-deployment-vm` through the instance metadata
value `enable-oslogin=TRUE`. It is not enabled project-wide. Each team member
has `roles/compute.osAdminLogin` on project `iac-dev-01` and
`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` on the instance's attached service account.

| Team account | Configuration | Shell verification |
|---|---|---|
| `cloudcompute97@gmail.com` | Configured | Verified on 2026-09-03 |
| `maximiliano.rubio@udem.edu` | Configured | Verified by member on 2026-09-03 |
| `estefania.najera@udem.edu` | Configured | Verified by member on 2026-09-03 |
| `raquel.delagarzav@udem.edu` | Configured | Verified by member on 2026-09-03 |

Each member verifies their own identity and shell with:

```sh
gcloud auth login MEMBER_EMAIL
gcloud config set project iac-dev-01
gcloud compute ssh mosaiq-deployment-vm \
  --zone=northamerica-south1-a \
  --command="whoami && hostname"
```

The expected hostname is `mosaiq-deployment-vm`. Every member completed the
personal verification for `F1-02` on 2026-09-03.
